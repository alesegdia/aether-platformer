## Mechanics

The Apocalypsis is happening. You are in the ruins of what was a church and parishioners will come to your church's entrance to get salvation. You need to aid as many parishioners as you can to reunite with The Creator. In order to achieve this, you need banks so parishioners can sit to pray, but that won't suffice, as you need relics in order to make their pray effective. There are 3 types of relics, from lower to higher pray power:

* Medal of the Virgen of the Rocio
* A priest
* A cherub

The more parishioners are praying, the lower praying power there will be. You earn God's Favor with each parishioners saved.

From time to time, relics will become evil, thus increasing the apocalypsis level. With apocalypsis level increase, parishioners will come to your church more frequently.
